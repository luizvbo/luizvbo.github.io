This paper takes a new step in this direction, proposing a different approach to measure the quality of the symbolic regression benchmarks quantitatively. The proposed approach is based on meta-learning and uses a set of dataset meta-features---such as the number of examples or output skewness---to describe the datasets. Our idea is to correlate these meta-features with the errors obtained by a GP method. These meta-features define a space of benchmarks that should, ideally, have datasets (points) covering different regions of the space. An initial analysis of 63 datasets showed that current benchmarks are concentrated in a small region of this benchmark space. We also found out that number of instances and output skewness are the most relevant meta-features to GP output error. Both conclusions can help define which datasets should compose an effective testbed for symbolic regression methods.","tags":null,"title":"Analysing Symbolic Regression Benchmarks under a Meta-Learning Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joao Francisco B.

As a machine learning technique, Genetic Programming (GP) is not immune to this problem, which the field has frequently addressed. Recently, Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming (GSGP), a semantic-aware branch of GP, has shown robustness and high generalization capability. Researchers believe these characteristics may be associated with a lower sensibility to noisy data. However, there is no systematic study on this matter. This paper performs a deep analysis of the GSGP performance over the presence of noise. Using 15 synthetic datasets where noise can be controlled, we added different ratios of noise to the data and compared the results obtained with those of a canonical GP. The results show that, as we increase the percentage of noisy instances, the generalization performance degradation is more pronounced in GSGP than GP. However, in general, GSGP is more robust to noise than GP in the presence of up to 10% of noise, and presents no statistical difference for values higher than that in the test bed.","tags":null,"title":"How Noisy Data Affects Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex G.

Following this idea, this paper proposes RECIPE (REsilient ClassifIcation Pipeline Evolution), a framework based on grammar-based genetic programming that builds customized classification pipelines. The framework is flexible enough to receive different grammars and can be easily extended to other machine learning tasks. RECIPE overcomes the drawbacks of previous evolutionary-based frameworks, such as generating invalid individuals, and organizes a high number of possible suitable data pre-processing and classification methods into a grammar. Results of f-measure obtained by RECIPE are compared to those two state-of-the-art methods, and shown to be as good as or better than those previously reported in the literature.

In particular, the geometric semantic genetic programming (GSGP) and the interesting properties of its evolutionary operators have gotten the attention of the community. This paper is interested in the use of GSGP to solve symbolic regression problems, where semantics is defined by the output set generated by a given individual when applied to the training cases. In this scenario, both mutation and crossover operators defined with fitness function based on Manhattan distance use randomly built functions to generate offspring. However, the outputs of these random functions are not guaranteed to be uniformly distributed in the semantic space, as the functions are generated considering the syntactic space. We hypothesize that the non-uniformity of the semantics of these functions may bias the search, and propose three different standard normalization techniques to improve the distribution of the outputs of these random functions over the semantic space. The results are compared with a popular strategy that uses a logistic function as a wrapper to the outputs, and show that the strategies tested can improve the results of the previous method. The experimental analysis also indicates that a more uniform distribution of the semantics of these functions does not necessarily imply in better results in terms of test error.","tags":null,"title":"Strategies for Improving the Distribution of Random Function Outputs in GSGP","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

Although the mutation operator alleviates this problem, we cannot guarantee it will find promising regions of the search space within feasible computational time. In this direction, this paper proposes a new geometric dispersion operator that uses multiplicative factors to move individuals to less dense areas of the search space around the target solution before applying semantic genetic operators.

One of the common definitions of the semantic space in the context of symbolic regression is a n-dimensional space, where n corresponds to the number of training examples. In problems where this number is high, the search process can became harder as the number of dimensions increase. Geometric semantic genetic programming (GSGP) explores the semantic space by performing geometric semantic operations—the fitness landscape seen by GSGP is guaranteed to be conic by construction. Intuitively, a lower number of dimensions can make search more feasible in this scenario, decreasing the chances of data overfitting and reducing the number of evaluations required to find a suitable solution. This paper proposes two approaches for dimensionality reduction in GSGP: (i) to apply current instance selection methods as a pre-process step before training points are given to GSGP; (ii) to incorporate instance selection to the evolution of GSGP. Experiments in 15 datasets show that GSGP performance is improved by using instance reduction during the evolution.","tags":null,"title":"Reducing Dimensionality to Improve Search in Semantic Genetic Programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luiz Otavio V.

The SSR method is inspired by the sequential covering strategy from machine learning, but instead of sequentially reducing the size of the problem being solved, it sequentially transforms the original problem into potentially simpler problems. This transformation is performed according to the semantic distances between the desired and obtained outputs and a geometric semantic operator. The rationale behind SSR is that, after generating a suboptimal function f via symbolic regression, the output errors can be approximated by another function, in a subsequent iteration. The method was tested in eight polynomial functions, and compared with canonical genetic programming (GP) and geometric semantic genetic programming (SGP). Results showed that SSR significantly outperforms SGP and presents no statistical difference from GP. More importantly, they show the potential of the proposed approach: an effective way of applying geometric semantic operators to combine different (partial) solutions, and at the same time, avoiding the exponential growth problem arising from the use of semantic operators.","tags":null,"title":"Sequential Symbolic Regression with Genetic Programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julio Albinati","Gisele L.
